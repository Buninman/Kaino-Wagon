# Kaino Wagon. My first three.js website
The website was created for learning purposes. I tried to use everything I learned. The website may be quite meaningless, but it looks good, doesn't it? 
You can see it here:

- The loader and 3D model were created in Blender 
- All animation was created using JS and GLSL
- All textures are created by baking. There is no light in the scene

It was a long journey in learning JS, Three.js, and Blender. I am very grateful to Bruno Simon for creating such an inspiring portfolio with the red car. I am glad to learn from the best. I bought his course and am happy to learn from the best.
